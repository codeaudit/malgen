Release date 2009-04-29

  Features
    1. Fixed-width fields.  See the FIXED_WIDTH.txt file in the docs directory
       of the source package for more information.
    2. Added the -t, --truncate option which at the expense of strictly
       following the statistical distribution,  generates exactly the number of
       specified records. See the STRICT_OPTION.txt file in the docs directory
       of the source package for more information.

  Bugs

Version 0.8
Release date 2009-04-20

  Features
    1. Removed the historical Aux field.  This reduced the number of fields to
       five from six.
    2. Records are now a fixed length.  Each recorded generated is 100 bytes
       unless values are used for the distributions which make this impossible.
